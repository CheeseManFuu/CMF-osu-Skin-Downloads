Important notes:

The root of the skins' folders contains a folder, /alternates/. This folder is exactly as it sounds, which includes things from older versions.

The root of the skins' folders contains a document called "picture credits.txt." This folder contains Danbooru links to images used and the fonts used in the skin. If I'm missing something, please tell me.

As for every version, please tell me if there is a problem that you've found in any of the variants with anything skin-related or credit related, or simply PM me for suggestions.
