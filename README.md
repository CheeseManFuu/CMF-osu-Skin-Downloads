This page is a large container of my osu! skins, dating back to November 2016 to the current, developing version!

Click the banners (or links) to download their respective skin. https://cheesemanfuu.github.io/CMF-osu-Skin-Downloads/

The page uses the Modernist Jekyll theme, which very much simplifies the process of making a webapage, making the creator only need to know Markdown to make a nice website.
