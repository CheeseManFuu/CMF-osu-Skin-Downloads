This page is a large container of my osu! skins, dating back to November 2016 to the current, developing version!

Click the download links to download their respective skin. Quick-access link: https://cheesemanfuu.github.io/CMF-osu-Skin-Downloads/

The page uses the Modernist Jekyll theme, which very much simplifies the process of making a webpage, making the creator only need to know Markdown to make a nice website.
